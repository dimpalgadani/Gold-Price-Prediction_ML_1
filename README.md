# 💰 Gold-Price-Prediction_ML_1

###  Gold Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the future price of gold based on historical market trends and financial indicators using Machine Learning regression models.

### 🔍 Project Overview

Performed data preprocessing, feature selection, and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.

Trained models including model_selection, RandomForestRegressor, and metrics for price prediction.

Achieved R² = 0.98 on the final model.

The model helps investors and analysts make data-driven predictions about future gold price movements.
